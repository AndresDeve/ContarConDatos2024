It has naturalised in numerous places, especially tropical islands, across the world. On Christmas Island, Hormiga loca amarillas are decimating the island’s iconic red land crabs. A significant population also exists in the Northern Territory. Hormiga loca amarillas were first detected in 2001 in Cairns. Since then, more than 20 additional sites have been found, in and around Cairns, Townsville, Hervey Bay, Caboolture and Brisbane. The total area of infestation involves at least 320 hectares. Populations at some of these sites have been eliminated, whereas others are subject to ongoing control.

A., Alcorlo, P., & Montes, C.	"Research on biological invasions has traditionally focused on the ecological component of
invasive alien species, either without considering or by considering in a restricted way, the
knowledge of the social component. An understanding of the human dimension of invasions
is critical to effectively tackle the problems associated with invasive alien species.
We distributed questionnaires to evaluate the social perceptions and attitudes of different
stakeholder groups affected by invasive alien species in the Donana social–ecological system
(SW Spain). Our analysis served to characterize respondents based on their knowledge
and perceptions of the impacts of invasive alien species, and the attitudes toward their
introduction and eradication. Hierarchical cluster and principal component analyses identified
five categories of respondents, and potential support of eradication programs was
assessed using a contingent valuation approach. The five stakeholder groups differed in
their degree of knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and willingness to pay for eradication.
The fact that different stakeholders have remarkably different perceptions about the
impacts and benefits caused by invasive alien species, and different attitudes toward their
introduction or eradication should be considered in any decision-making process regarding
their management, particularly when developing appropriate educational and informative
programs. Consultation with different stakeholders should also be encouraged from the
onset of any decision-making process. In this way, trade-offs involved in IAS management
are directly addressed and successful implementation of management practices is
facilitated."

Tiritiri Matangi Island in the Hauraki Gulf, Auckland, New Zealand is a 220 ha restoration island managed by the Department of Conservation as an open sanctuary. Following eradication of the only mammalian predator, the Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) in 1993, a variety of threatened birds, lizards and a giant invertebrate have been transferred to the island. In March 2000, Hormiga argentina (Linepithema humile) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) was discovered and delimiting surveys revealed a 10 ha infestation. Managers were concerned that the ant could have significant negative impacts on invertebrates, birds and lizards. Early surveys confirmed a dramatic decline in all other ant species within the infested area. In February 2001, an eradication programme commenced with paste baits (a.i. 0.01% fipronil) spread manually in a 2 m × 3 m grid over the entire area. The second year employed a 1 m × 3 m spacing. A second incursion part way through the programme extended the area to 11 ha. The same toxic bait was used throughout the programme to kill residual colonies and a non-toxic version was used as a lure to intensively monitor progress. Eradication was declared in 2016. Critical parts of the programme included detection of post treatment survivors and the level of effort required to confirm successful eradication. New treatment techniques were developed to kill the last small nests by placing toxic baits inside vials on the ground to prolong bait life. Such nests exhibited non-invasive behaviour, short foraging distances, and were prone to disturbance leading to foraging cessation. Bait densities and field placement were critical to success. Sites with residual nests were deemed free of Hormiga argentina once there had been no detections over three consecutive years of ongoing monitoring. With few successful Hormiga argentina eradications in the world the techniques used here can inform and improve success rates for other ant eradication attempts.

After initially becoming hyper-abundant, invaders can decline to local or regional extinction. Pathogens and their interaction with host immunity have been proposed as the cause of these declines. Pathogens may be lethal or have sub-lethal effects, reducing the competitive ability of invaders by forcing them to allocate valuable resources to their immune systems. We will determine how pathogens and their hosts immune response influence a globally widespread invader’s competitive ability, persistence, and population and community dynamics. Hormiga argentinas will be used as a model study system. We will stifle the Hormiga argentina’s immunity to a suite of known viral pathogens and bacteria using gene silencing via specifically designed dsRNA. Several different immune pathways and genes will be targeted. We will investigate the role of immunity in inter-specific interactions and the fitness of these ants in laboratory trials. Finally, a field experiment will attempt to instigate a pathogen epidemic using dsRNA treatments designed to maximally impact Hormiga argentina immunity. Gene silencing and dsRNA technology is an emerging tool that offers immense potential to advance our understanding of how physiology influences ecology. It has also been suggested as the “next generation” of pest control techniques.

Marsden Fund	Are humans driving the evolution of invasive species to our own detriment? Humans unwittingly and routinely transport invasive animals and plants around the globe. We hypothesise that this process leads to selection for behavioural traits that enhance invasiveness. Our project will test this hypothesis with the Hormiga argentina, which is listed among the world’s worst invasive species, and considered the ‘Genghis Khan’ of the ant world. We will study populations from the native and introduced range to assess if: 1) variation in novelty-seeking behaviour exists among populations of ants; 2) this variation in behaviour has a molecular basis; 3) humans have exerted selection pressure on this behaviour; and 4) novelty-seeking promotes invasiveness. We will combine surveys of ecological communities, behavioural experiments, studies of population genetics, and gene and neurochemical expression. The scale of this analysis - from genes to communities, across four continents - is novel and integrative. Our international, multi-disciplinary team is ideally placed to achieve our project goals, with specialists in invasive species behaviour, ecology and evolution, neurobiology and socio-genomics. This novel research will advance invasion biology by elucidating for the first time an underlying mechanism of how evolution and ecology interact to facilitate invasion success.

This study assesses the efficacy and nontarget risk of a precision ant baiting method aiming to reduce a population of the invasive big-headed ant Pheidole megacephala on a tropical island of great conservation value. Area-wide application of a formicidal bait, delivered in bait stations, resulted in the rapid decline of 8 ha of P. megacephala. Effective suppression remained throughout the succeeding 11-month monitoring period. We detected no negative effects of baiting on nontarget arthropods. Indeed, species richness of nontarget ants and abundance of other soil-surface arthropods increased significantly after P. megacephala suppression. This bait station method minimized bait exposure to nontarget organisms and was cost effective and adaptable to target species density. However, it was only effective over short distances and required thorough bait placement. This method would therefore be most appropriate for localized P. megacephala infestations where the prevention of nontarget impacts is essential. The methodology used here would be applicable to other sensitive tropical environments.

Over
the past 15 years, a numerous studies were published on the impacts of this species on flora, fauna, and ecosystem
function in natural and agricultural systems. We reviewed the literature on S. invicta invasion biology and impacts on
biodiversity in South China. Both monogyne and polygyne colonies of S. invicta were introduced to China and polygyne
colony is the dominant type. The range expansion rate of S. invicta may reach 26.5–48.1 km yr–1 in China. S. invicta
forage activities occur year-round, peaking in the summer and fall in South China and show a preference for insects and
plant seeds. We describe the ecological impacts of S. invicta on various habitats in South China, including arthropod
community structure disruption and decreases in diversity and abundance of native ant species. S. invicta can replace
the role of native ants in mutualisms between ants and honeydew-producing Hemiptera, which results in loss of important
food resources for native ants and natural enemies of hemipterans. Further research is required to assess the complex
ecosystem-level impacts of S. invicta in introduced areas."

The Hormiga de fuego importada roja, Solenopsis invicta, has created billions of dollars in costs annually, spreading as an invasive species across the southern United States. In 1998, the Hormiga de fuego importada roja spread into California creating a highly probable future introduction via shipped products to Hawaii. This paper presents the estimation of potential economic impacts of the Hormiga de fuego importada roja (RIFA) to the state of Hawaii. Evaluation of impacts focuses on the economic sectors of (1) households, (2) agriculture (cattle and crop production), (3) infrastructure (cemeteries, churches, cities, electrical, telephone, and cable services, highways, hospitals and schools), (4) recreation, tourism and business (hotels/resort areas, golf courses, commercial busi- nesses and tourists), and (5) government expenditures (with minimal intervention). The full annual economic costs of the Hormiga de fuego importada roja to Hawaii are estimated (in US$ 2006) to be $211 million/year, comprised of $77 million in damages and expenditures and $134 million in foregone outdoor opportunities to households and tourists. The present value of the projected costs of RIFA over a 20-year period after introduction total $2.5 billion. RIFA invasions across the globe indicate that economic cost-effective action in Hawaii entails implementation of prevention, early detection and rapid response treatment programs for RIFA.

The Hormiga de fuego importada roja, Solenopsis invicta, has created billions of dollars in costs annually, spreading as an invasive species across the southern United States. In 1998, the Hormiga de fuego importada roja spread into California creating a highly probable future introduction via shipped products to Hawaii. This paper presents the estimation of potential economic impacts of the Hormiga de fuego importada roja (RIFA) to the state of Hawaii. Evaluation of impacts focuses on the economic sectors of (1) households, (2) agriculture (cattle and crop production), (3) infrastructure (cemeteries, churches, cities, electrical, telephone, and cable services, highways, hospitals and schools), (4) recreation, tourism and business (hotels/resort areas, golf courses, commercial busi- nesses and tourists), and (5) government expenditures (with minimal intervention). The full annual economic costs of the Hormiga de fuego importada roja to Hawaii are estimated (in US$ 2006) to be $211 million/year, comprised of $77 million in damages and expenditures and $134 million in foregone outdoor opportunities to households and tourists. The present value of the projected costs of RIFA over a 20-year period after introduction total $2.5 billion. RIFA invasions across the globe indicate that economic cost-effective action in Hawaii entails implementation of prevention, early detection and rapid response treatment programs for RIFA.

Wylie F Ross & Janssen-May Sharon	n Australia, a national eradication programme for the Hormiga de fuego importada roja (Solenopsis invicta Buren), one of the world’s most invasive species, has been in operation since 2001 when the pest was first detected in Brisbane, Queensland. Since that time, four separate incursions of this ant have been successfully eradicated from this country, but the main Brisbane population remains. Cost-benefit analyses already conducted put the likely impact of Hormiga de fuego importada roja in Australia, if not eradicated, at between A$8.5 and A $45 billion. Despite this, ongoing funding for the eradication programme is not assured. A recent external review has concluded that it remains technically feasible, cost beneficial and in the national interest to eradicate. In support of previous analyses, our study high- lights some of the potential impacts of Hormiga de fuego importada roja in Australia in more detail and provides case examples. Results show that adverse impacts are likely in most sectors of the economy, and will be felt not only by agricultural industries, but also the building and construction, tourism, electrical and communications industries. In addition to industry effects, there will also be negative impacts on public health and lifestyle, the environment and infrastructure such as main roads, airports and schools. Our estimates of potential cost impacts in the case examples where extrapolation was possible exceed A$1.65 billion/year and support previous predictions. We conclude that increased spending is justified to avert ‘invasion debt’ – the future cost of battling pests that escape today. This is a war that Aus- tralia cannot afford to lose.

Invasive ants pose significant risks to the environment and economy, which are well-managed by biosecurity agencies in developed countries. However, a comprehen- sive view of the potential impacts of invasive ants in developing Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) is lacking. We quantified the potential costs of the Hormiga de fuego importada roja (Solenopsis invicta Buren) across multiple sectors using an extrapolation analysis. Overall, we estimated that the impacts of Hormiga de fuego importada roja on developing PICTs could amount to over USD 329 million annually, corresponding to approximately 0.7% of combined GDP. Over half of the costs were predicted to result from impacts on the agriculture sector, a major source of employment and subsistence. We found that over 350 highly threatened species could be at risk from Hormiga de fuego importada roja. We would expect countries with Least Developed Country status and relatively low GDP to be least able to respond to an incursion of these ants, and as a result the costs could be higher than we have extrapolated. Hormiga de fuego importada roja could therefore potentially have considerable impact on the on-going development of the region.

Over half of the costs were predicted to result from impacts on the agriculture sector, a major source of employment and subsistence. We found that over 350 highly threatened species could be at risk from Hormiga de fuego importada roja. We would expect countries with Least Developed Country status and relatively low GDP to be least able to respond to an incursion of these ants, and as a result the costs could be higher than we have extrapolated. Hormiga de fuego importada roja could therefore potentially have considerable impact on the on-going development of the region.

Invasive ants pose significant risks to the environment and economy, which are well-managed by biosecurity agencies in developed countries. However, a comprehen- sive view of the potential impacts of invasive ants in developing Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) is lacking. We quantified the potential costs of the Hormiga de fuego importada roja (Solenopsis invicta Buren) across multiple sectors using an extrapolation analysis. Overall, we estimated that the impacts of Hormiga de fuego importada roja on developing PICTs could amount to over USD 329 million annually, corresponding to approximately 0.7% of combined GDP. Over half of the costs were predicted to result from impacts on the agriculture sector, a major source of employment and subsistence. We found that over 350 highly threatened species could be at risk from Hormiga de fuego importada roja. We would expect countries with Least Developed Country status and relatively low GDP to be least able to respond to an incursion of these ants, and as a result the costs could be higher than we have extrapolated. Hormiga de fuego importada roja could therefore potentially have considerable impact on the on-going development of the region.

Overall, we estimated that the impacts of Hormiga de fuego importada roja on developing PICTs could amount to over USD 329 million annually, corresponding to approximately 0.7% of combined GDP. Over half of the costs were predicted to result from impacts on the agriculture sector, a major source of employment and subsistence. We found that over 350 highly threatened species could be at risk from Hormiga de fuego importada roja. We would expect countries with Least Developed Country status and relatively low GDP to be least able to respond to an incursion of these ants, and as a result the costs could be higher than we have extrapolated. Hormiga de fuego importada roja could therefore potentially have considerable impact on the on-going development of the region.

To prevent transboundary expansion, the Chinese government has formulated various control strategies in the last 15 years to slow down the spread of S. invicta. Despite all efforts, S. invicta invasion has reached more than 390 counties of 13 provinces and two special administrative regions in China; at present, S. invicta remains at the stage of rapid expansion. The transnational entry of S. invicta is linked to imported logs and wastepaper coming mostly from the United States. In domestic settings, long-distance expansion of S. invicta relied on potted plant and turf transportation. Both monogyne and polygyne social forms of S. invicta were present in China with polygyne colonies as the dominant one. Data on population and breeding dynamics of S. invicta reveal the presence of two peaks annually with nuptial flights occurring throughout the year. Arthropods, plant seeds, and honeydew are important food sources of S. invicta, thereby causing negative impacts on the abundance, diversity, and richness of native arthropod communi- ties. Fire ants are threats not only to agriculture and power facilities, but also to human health, with more than 30% of people having suffered from the sting and 10% having experienced an allergic reaction. To address the expansion of S. invicta, the National Fire Ant Detection and Management Union was estab- lished and the formulation and implementation of management policies were drawn. Plant quarantine be- comes an essential step in fire ant management, whereas the two-step method of combing toxic baits and contact dust emerges as the forefront method crucial in managing S. invicta. The experience and lessons learned from fire ant management in China could benefit other countries when facing similar challenges.

Existing programs at state agencies address some of the core needs in this area, including inspection and quarantine at ports (HDOA), control of invasive plants and animals on state lands (DLNR), detection and control of vectors of human disease (DOH), control of invasive species along public transportation routes (DOT), planning initiatives (DBEDT), and academic expertise (UH). HISC-funded projects do not replace these core programs. Interagency HISC funds are used to complement these existing programs by:
Filling gaps between agency mandates or existing agency programs, and/or
Advancing our collective knowledge through research and development of new tools.
Disbursement of project funding via the HISC ensures that, at the cabinet level, multiple state agencies are identifying and prioritizing actions on annual basis that might otherwise go unfunded."

Wasmannia auropunctata, known as the Little Fire Ant (LFA), was first detected on the island of Hawai‘i (the Big Island) in 1999. It was most probably introduced through imports of contaminated potted plants from mainland USA. We estimate that LFA has now spread to over 4,000 locations on the Big Island and under current management efforts will spread rapidly inundating the Big Island in 15-20 years. Increased efforts in prevention, detections, and mitigation treatments will suppress existing infestations, reduce rate of spread and decrease long term management costs, damages, and human stings. Benefits from increased management are estimated to be $5 billion savings including $540 million in reduced damages and 2.1 billion fewer sting incidents over 35 years.

During the current phase of this project, capacity for managing this issue has been increased and project staff now have the knowledge and skills required to undertake long-term management of this emerging issue. Without action, the future for Vanuatu may be unpleasant. Little Fire Ants will continue to spread throughout the archipelago and impacts will increase in proportion to the area occupied by this species, affecting agriculture, society, tourism and the environment. Recommendations for long-term management of this issue include: 1. Development and implementation of a national response plan, shaped by the technical feasibility of eradication, aggressive control or longer-term management of known infestations. 2. Active efforts to prevent spread of LFA to uninfected islands, including creation and delivery of public awareness information; and biosecurity efforts that detect and prevent the movement of infested items between islands. 3. Acquisition of long-term funding, including funding for dedicated personnel, infrastructure, materials and travel costs that address this issues through the medium-long term.

During the current phase of this project, capacity for managing this issue has been increased and project staff now have the knowledge and skills required to undertake long-term management of this emerging issue. Without action, the future for Vanuatu may be unpleasant. Little Fire Ants will continue to spread throughout the archipelago and impacts will increase in proportion to the area occupied by this species, affecting agriculture, society, tourism and the environment. Recommendations for long-term management of this issue include: 1. Development and implementation of a national response plan, shaped by the technical feasibility of eradication, aggressive control or longer-term management of known infestations. 2. Active efforts to prevent spread of LFA to uninfected islands, including creation and delivery of public awareness information; and biosecurity efforts that detect and prevent the movement of infested items between islands. 3.

Existing programs at state agencies address some of the core needs in this area, including inspection and quarantine at ports (HDOA), control of invasive plants and animals on state lands (DLNR), detection and control of vectors of human disease (DOH), control of invasive species along public transportation routes (DOT), planning initiatives (DBEDT), and academic expertise (UH). HISC-funded projects do not replace these core programs. Interagency HISC funds are used to complement these existing programs by:
Filling gaps between agency mandates or existing agency programs, and/or
Advancing our collective knowledge through research and development of new tools.
Disbursement of project funding via the HISC ensures that, at the cabinet level, multiple state agencies are identifying and prioritizing actions on annual basis that might otherwise go unfunded."
